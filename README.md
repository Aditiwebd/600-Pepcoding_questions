# 600-Pepcoding_questions
This is a personal repository to keep track of all the questions I have solved in the 600 questions list made by Pepcoding. Btw if anybody is seeing this who wants to learn **DSA** I would highly recommend Pepcoding :smiley:.  
PS: I am open to different types of approaches.
